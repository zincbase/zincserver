# ZincServer

ZincServer is a high-performance server back-end for [ZincDB]() and beyond. Written in Go.

### Status

The software is mostly feature complete, but still at an alpha level of stability. Additional real-world testing is required before it is ready for production use. To help turn this into a mature, stable product, please report any crash or unexpected behavior.

### Platform support

Currently only tested on Linux and Windows. Might build on other platforms as well. Big endian targets are not supported yet, but may be in the future.
